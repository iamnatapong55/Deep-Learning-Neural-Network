# AI-Powered Room Decoration App

This project began as a personal experiment during my move to a new state, aiming to simplify the process of decorating my new apartment. The AI-Powered Room Decoration App is the result of this journey, blending my self-taught tech skills with my need for creative interior design solutions. It showcases the potential of AI to personalize and visualize living spaces, making it a practical tool born out of my real-life relocation challenge.

Welcome to the AI-Powered Room Decoration App, a tool designed to revolutionize the way you think about and approach interior design. Leveraging the power of Stable Diffusion, this app allows users to visualize their design ideas by transforming photos of their current space into the room of their dreams, based on their preferences for style, color, and furniture.
